#---------------New Building Alterations and Letters of Intent--------

#Purpose:
# 485x will be new buildings that filed with Department of Buildings most likely after 2022 
# They may have already sent in letters of intent to Housing Preservation and Development
# But, it's possible that they have not sent in the letter of intent
# Most new buildings will probably use 485x, so we can also use all new buildings 
# and be reasonably confident the majority will use 485x.
