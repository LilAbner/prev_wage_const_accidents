## Examine whether prevailing wage levels of 485x/41a has any effect on workplace construction accidents

## Background: 
 485X, the successor to 421a, will likely be the main driver of housing production in New York City through the next decade. Certain projects require prevailing wages, and this was a heavily-debated topic when creating the policy. Providing the prevailing wage is expensive. But, so are workplace accidents. Construction firms that follow prevailing wages or project labor agreements (which also satisifies the requirements) may have higher quality controls for workers, leading to less workplace accidents. 

## Research Question: Does the presence of prevailing wages have any effect on construction accidents?
