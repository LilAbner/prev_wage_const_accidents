# Examine whether prevailing wage levels of 485x has any effect on workplace construction accidents

# Background: 
# 485X, the successor to 421a, will likely be the main driver of housing production through the next decade. 
# A controversial part of 485X is the prevailing wage levels
# These set the wages for construction workers. 
# Different geographical areas have different prevailing wages, and it varies based on the size of the projects.
# Providing the prevailing wage is expensive.
# But, so are workplace accidents, especially in New York City.
# Construction firms that follow prevailing wages or project labor agreements (which also satisifies the requirements) may have higher quality controls for workers, leading to less workplace accidents.

# Research Question: Does the presence of prevailing wages have any effect on construction accidents?
